Human Activity Recognition with Deep Learning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a deep learning model for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using data from Kaggle. The project leverages state-of-the-art techniques to classify different types of human activities based on sensor data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains time-series data collected from motion sensors. It includes multiple classes of activities, such as walking, sitting, standing, and more.

Project Overview
The notebook in this repository includes the following:

Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
Model Development: Implementation of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models, to predict human activities.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics and visualization of results to assess model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Techniques used to optimize the model's performance.
